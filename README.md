# Rice Yield Prediction using LSTM

## Overview
This project aims to predict **rice yield** using **time series analysis with LSTM neural networks**.  
By leveraging **weather data from the Korea Meteorological Administration** along with **rice production statistics**, we forecast future yields using deep learning techniques.

## Data Processing
The dataset undergoes several preprocessing steps:
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and removing inconsistencies.
- **Filtering & Normalization**: Standardizing numerical features for efficient model training.

Additionally, **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** is conducted to identify key features and patterns in the data.

## Model Development
The **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** network is trained to analyze temporal dependencies in the data.  
To optimize performance:
- **Grid Search** is applied for hyperparameter tuning.
- **Training & Evaluation** follow best practices in deep learning.

## Results & Visualization
After training, predictions are visualized to assess model accuracy and forecast trends.  
The findings provide valuable insights for agricultural planning and yield estimation.
